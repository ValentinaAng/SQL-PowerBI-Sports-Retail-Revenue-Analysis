# SQL-Sports-Retail-Revenue-Analysis
In this SQL task, I used the Sports Retail Revenue dataset, which is available https://www.kaggle.com/code/nickleejh/optimizing-online-sports-retail-revenue-using-sql. 
The primary objective of this project is to boost the revenue of an online retail company by providing actionable insights and recommendations for its marketing and sales teams. 
Specifically, the analysis aims to identify which brands are performing well in terms of sales and to develop strategies to boost sales for underperforming brands.

Additionally, I created a straightforward Power BI report to visualize key metrics and trends, aiding in the interpretation of the data and facilitating informed decision-making for the company's stakeholders.
